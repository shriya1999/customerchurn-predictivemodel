# Telecom Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using two machine learning models: **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**. The dataset contains customer demographic and usage data. By analyzing this data, we can determine the likelihood of customers leaving the company, which is crucial for retaining high-value customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a customer dataset from a telecom company. Each row represents a customer, and the columns describe various attributes such as customer demographics, services, and their status regarding churn.

### Columns:
- **customerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **gender**: Customerâ€™s gender (Male, Female)
- **SeniorCitizen**: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (0: No, 1: Yes)
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes, No)
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes, No)
- **tenure**: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
- **PhoneService**: Whether the customer has phone service (Yes, No)
- **MultipleLines**: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes, No, No phone service)
- **InternetService**: Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, No)
- **OnlineSecurity**: Whether the customer has online security add-on (Yes, No, No internet service)
- **OnlineBackup**: Whether the customer has online backup add-on (Yes, No, No internet service)
- **DeviceProtection**: Whether the customer has device protection add-on (Yes, No, No internet service)
- **TechSupport**: Whether the customer has tech support add-on (Yes, No, No internet service)
- **StreamingTV**: Whether the customer uses streaming TV service (Yes, No, No internet service)
- **StreamingMovies**: Whether the customer uses streaming movies service (Yes, No, No internet service)
- **Contract**: Contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
- **PaperlessBilling**: Whether the customer uses paperless billing (Yes, No)
- **PaymentMethod**: Payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card)
- **MonthlyCharges**: The monthly amount charged to the customer
- **TotalCharges**: The total amount charged to the customer
- **Churn**: Whether the customer churned (Yes, No)

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major concern for businesses as it indicates that customers are leaving for competitors. This project aims to predict customer churn based on past behavior and customer attributes, helping the company focus on retaining customers who are at risk of leaving.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, contract type).
   - Standardize numerical features like `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, and `TotalCharges`.
   - One-hot encoding for variables such as `InternetService` and `PaymentMethod`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize correlations between features and churn.
   - Analyze customer tenure, service usage, and payment method patterns.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Implement two machine learning models: **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**.
   - Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare model performance based on Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and the Confusion Matrix.
   - Generate insights from the models to understand the key factors contributing to churn.

## Modeling Approach

### Random Forest
- Random Forest is an ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification. This helps in improving model accuracy by reducing overfitting.
- We use Random Forest to capture complex relationships between customer features and churn.

### Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression is a linear model commonly used for binary classification tasks.
- It outputs probabilities to classify customers as churned or not based on their attributes.

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Focuses on how many of the churn predictions were correct.
- **Recall**: Measures how well the model captures actual churned customers.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

## Results
- Random Forest showed higher precision but slightly lower recall compared to Logistic Regression.
- Logistic Regression performed well in terms of overall accuracy but missed some churn predictions compared to Random Forest.
- Insights from both models indicate that contract type, tenure, and monthly charges are among the key factors influencing churn.
